# ArcGIS-Extensions-for-various-spatial-analysis-purposes
Although, ArcMap is such a robust software, it still needs to be enriched by adding more specific functionalities which are not included into ArcGIS packages. This can be done by developing embedded extensions. This will provide possibility of using new added functions along with all advanced spatial capabilities in ArcMap. Also more convenient, any new software license is not required. 

This repository includes only a part of the whole project code.
